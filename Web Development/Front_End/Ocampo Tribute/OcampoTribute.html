            She knows what's good. But do we? Studies show that 23 out of 57 chumps don't know what's good.  Don't be a statistic.  Chumps don't know what's good and Erica Ocampo doesn't wanna know chumps.  It is your responsibility to know what's good.  This chick is responsible as fuggg and you should be too!

                     <p> 
            Erica Ocampo may know what's good.  But do we know what's good for <span style="font-size:20px; color:DeepPink">her</span>?  I would like to think so! You may think I'm gonna say something along the line of <em>"Deez Nuts!"</em>, but you would be mistaken.  Although they might very well be, there is only one thing we know for certain would be good for her...and that is...

            The First Mistake is not good for anyone and it is most certainly not good for her.  It is well known that Taco Bell is not only a mistake, but that it is <em>always</em> the <strong> first </strong> mistake.  You think anybody is gonna catch this chick nommin' on stanky taco bell...<strong>hell no!</strong>  It is unfathomable, and as such, we can postulate that this just cannot happen.  She would never make the First Mistake since, as stated previously, it is not good for her.  And she obviously knows what's good!  But perhaps you are not convinced that she does, in fact, know what's good.  In which case, you sir are clearly trippin'.  However, since I cannot simply let such ignorance slide, let us prove it. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Even though it is blasphemous, let us assume that Erica Ocampo does not know what's good. Thus, Erica Ocampo could possibly make the first mistake.  Which implies that she would consider eating at Taco Bell.  And if she would make such a consideration, then it is possible that somebody could catch this chick nommin' on some stanky taco bell.  In reference to an earlier postulate, this is not possible.  Hence, she could not make the First Mistake, or else it would be possible.  Furthermore, she has never made a second mistake, since by definition, she would have to have made a first mistake to have committed a second.  And we know that Taco Bell is <strong>always</strong> the first mistake. Hence, Erica Ocampo doesn't make mistakes. This contradicts our assertion that Erica Ocampo could possibly make the first mistake. Therefore, by contradiction, Erica Ocampo knows what's good.
